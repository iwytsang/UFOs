# UFOs

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to create an expanded filter for the UFOs webpage that can filter the UFOs data table, not only by date, but also by city, state, country and state. 

## Results

The user of the website can use the search filter to type a value into the text boxes and press the "enter" button on their keyboard in order to filter the table with UFO data on the website. 

As the default, the UFO table on the website has all data that is not filtered as per the below website.

When the user filters, they enter in a value like in the example below, "el cajon" as a city was entered and once the "enter" button was pressed, the data was filtered for only the values which have the city as "el cajon".

The user can even filter for more than one search value, like in the example below, the city was filtered as "el cajon" but the date was filtered for only all values that include both the city "el cajon" and date "1/4/2010".

## Summary

### Drawback
One drawback of this new website design is that it can't filter for one value in a filter OR another value in a different filter. It only filters for both at the same time. Example: it can't filter for city as "benton" OR shape as "circle".

### Additional Recommendations
One recommendation to further improve the website would be to allow filtering of the value for additional boolean operators like "OR" and "NOT" in the search. This would allow the user to filter even further in their search within the UFO data.

Another recommendation would be for the table to start filtering as soon as the user starts typing the search filter value. For example, when the user types "el cajon", and they only have typed "el", the table will filter without needing to press the "enter" key. This will be much quicker to display data for the user and it is a more effective way to search.
