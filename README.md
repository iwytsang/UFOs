# UFOs

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to create an expanded filter for the UFOs webpage that can filter the UFOs data table, not only by date, but also by city, state, country and state. 

## Results

The user of the website can use the search filter to type a value into the text boxes and press the "enter" button on their keyboard in order to filter the table with UFO data on the website. 

As the default, the UFO table on the website has all data that is not filtered as per the below website.

When the user filters, they enter in a value like in the example below, "el cajon" as a city was entered and once the "enter" button was pressed, the data was filtered for only the values which have the city as "el cajon".

The user can even filter for more than one search value, like in the example below, the city was filtered as "el cajon" but the date was filtered for only all values that include both the city "el cajon" and date "1/4/2010".
